Idea
	This idea came to me when I envisioned creating a simple AI "ranch" of 
sorts, where you could watch ASCII characters that represent animals. These 
representations would have motives, such as eating, mating, and basic survival
and the goal of the simulation would be to keep it going as long as possible
with balance between predator and prey. It would include status bars for 
indicating hunger, total health, thirst, maybe some others for randomly-generated 
stats such as speed, attack power, fertility. One day I sat down and randomly had 
a lot more specific ideas on what I would like this to be like. I thought about 
the disappointment that EA's Spore had given me (it was a good game, but nothing near 
the hype train that it had gotten and was a little too playful). Another inspiring 
project is Rust, a game made by a relatively small developer who had no idea how 
popular its game would turn out to be (in early release even!). The idea of an open- 
ended game with a focus on the player's environment and freedom of interactivity 
is just about the closest thing you can get to being a perfect game. So the idea of 
this project was born. Essentially, I would like to combine ideas from both mentioned 
games, but hopefully it can flesh out to truly be its own experience. This is a game that 
I would like to see released purely for my own enjoyment along with my friends, meaning 
that I would rather it be a flop commercially but a masterpiece in my eyes.

Meta
	-OpenGL implementation
	-Support for Linux, Windows, possibly Android, Mac/iOS if tester available
	-Ultimate multi-platform, communication between ALL clients
	-Use of Blender for at least 3D modeling, either Unity3D or Blender for game engine
		-Would like to see an in-house game engine be added later; possibility for public release
	-Game focus on stability of ecosystem, cross between Rust and Spore (what Spore could have been, creature stage)
	-Possible switching between top-down and first/third-person
	-Tries to get casual tone, rather than taking itself too seriously (albeit not as playful as Spore; more along lines of Rust)
	-Evolutionary system for animals, plants (?)
	-Encyclopedia system when at certain level of player advancement
	-Possible space exploration
	-Robot use unlocked around same time as space travel
		-Would have costs, such as efficiency compared to humans
		-Can be used for tasks like resource collection, defense, ecology maintenance
	-Colonization of worlds, assignment of NPC/other player as governors
	-Mining of resources such as oil, rocket fuel
	-Space travel very costly, only a few trips allowed per resources on each planet
	-Nearby planets in player's solar system, randomness will be increased
		-May or may not have ecosystem, resources
	-Regeneration of complete solar system at permadeath
	-Connection of players' solar systems allowed on direct connection, server
		-Direct connection would allow small friend groups to coexist without grief
		-Server connection would implement Rust-style behavior, with random encounters

Player
	-Must balance between its own survival and that of its surroundings
	-Hidden events that trigger experience/leveling to mimic real human evolution and invention
		-Hidden to increase realism, not encourage "going through the motions"
		-Tool creation will be unlocked at semi-random experience
	-Cost for every action; may face decision between survival and advancement
	-Possible system of less mating = longer/indefinite lifespan
		-One mate will spawn at world start, can be killed
			-Decision to mate or explore at beginning
			-Will create necessity to maintain family at beginning
			-Advancement may leave player the option to disregard others
		-Not mating will have perks for sustaining knowledge
		-Mating will create continue points in the event of player death
			-Knowledge penalties for rebirth
			-Other humans will have own AI, diplomacy system
			-NPCs will be two/three levels behind player
			-Genes system, descendants will perform similar actions
			-NPCs would be less costly than robots, more efficient but may not always follow/appreciate directions
			-Patriarchy system, large number of NPCs may cause rebellions (opposing faction to player), infighting
		-Costs of mating
			-Time that could've been spent exploring/advancing
			-Effort put in to maintain relationship with mate
			-Risk of challenge from other humans if populous enough
			-Descendants may turn non-playable if diplomacy to (opinion of) current player falters
			-More descendants may mean increased mortality
		-Genocide option, can kill off NPCs to regain lifespan
			-NPCs will fight back
			-
	-Minimize disappointment upon death
		-Environment randomized on new start
		-Differing levels of predators/prey/ecosystem
			-Levels of ecology could include oxygen, water, spawn rate of trees (wood)
			-Environment could be heavily wooded or sparse in basic resources, further changing experiences
		-Player must adapt survival strategy for each world
			-Play style/methology changes; game itself may be considered different genre
		-Balancing will not always be the same between worlds
			-Some worlds will need more player involvement in balancing
			-Others will be self-sustaining

NPC
	-(Placeholder, need to move info from Player category)
	-Opposing factions (if population high enough and faction opinion of player low)
		-May colonize and move to nearby planets
		-Will inherit two/three levels beneath player, continue leveling at a slightly lower rate
		-Diplomacy/victory against faction leadership could allow reintegration into player's faction

Animals
	-Diplomacy system (friendly/aggressive/neutral) toward player
		-Individual- and species-generated at start
		-Can be affected by actions toward animals
		-Attacking (aggressive) and feeding (friendly) directly affect individual, will affect species if witnessed by others
		-Can operate on companion/pet system
	-Evolution, natural selection
		-Affects ecosystem balancing, may require player involvement
		-Occurs at random rates, does not follow player advancement timeline
		-Species can split after a period of separation
		-Can change distinction of predator/prey
	-Differing resources on death
		-Can be affected by evolution; i.e. loss of horns leads to loss of sharp weapon/spear tip for player

Multiplayer
	-Same diplomacy system from players/NPCs, new option for alliance
	-Alliance would allow players to utilize others' NPCs, faction opinion is then shared
		-Negative actions from other player would decrease opinion of original player
	-In-world action does not occur unless any player is active on world
